# Natural Language Processing Homework 1

Welcome to the repository for Natural Language Processing Homework 1. This project is part of the coursework for the Natural Language Processing (NLP) class at Cornell University.


# Project Overview

This assignment focuses on implementing and evaluating various NLP techniques, including:

Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stop-word removal.

Language Modeling: Building HMM models to predict and tag words in a sequence.

Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying and classifying entities in text.
